# Jetson Nano u-boot

The patches for the jetson nano u-boot are copied over from the [OpenEmbedded for Tegra project](https://github.com/OE4T/u-boot-tegra)

The OE4T project maintains patches from the NVIDA Tegra u-boot in upstream u-boot. The patches branch can be identified with the `patches-` prefix.

The diff is generated by looking at the commit history for the `patches-` branch and doing a diff between `HEAD` and the upstream u-boot release.

Eg:

For the `v2022.07` release of u-boot we'd be using `patches-v2022.07` branch of the OE4T project.

The diff is generated as:

`git diff e092e3250270a1016c877da7bdd9384f14b1321e HEAD --no-prefix`

where commit `e092e3250270a1016c877da7bdd9384f14b1321e` is the commit that started of the upstream u-boot [release](https://github.com/OE4T/u-boot-tegra/commit/e092e3250270a1016c877da7bdd9384f14b1321e).
